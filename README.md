# TriviaGame
Create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.

I created a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

-If the player selects the correct answer, It will show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it will display the next question

-If the player runs out of time, it will display time's up and the correct answer. then it will show the next question.

-If the player chooses the wrong answer, it will tell the player they selected the wrong option and it will display the correct answer. then it will show the next question.

-On the final screen, it will show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game
